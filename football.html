            The Giants are a great NFL organization with four Super Bowl Championships. They have won two championships in the last 10 years. They beat the Patriots both times in 2007 and 2011. Both games including spectacular clutch playing by David Tyree and Mario Manningham. They also won in 1987 and 1991. The Giants have been building their team the past years adding Odell Beckham Jr., Janoris Jankins, and other great player. This year they made the playoffs and lost but they are hoping to make the playoffs again next year.
