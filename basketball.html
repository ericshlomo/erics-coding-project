        <p1> The Knicks are a great basketball organization that have been around for 70 years, starting from 1946 to today. They play in one of the most famous arenas in Madison Square Garden. They had some great runs in the 90's but didn't win it all then but their best runs were in the 70's when they won two championships in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks started the 21st century without making the playoff from 2001-2010 after that they made the playoffs three times in a row with the help from All-Star Carmelo Anthony. The next season after making the playoffs they had their worst season in the history of the Knicks losing 65 games. Now the Knicks are hoping to try to make a playoff run with new additoins which include Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee. </p1>
